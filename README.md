# Pong-Arcade-Web-Application

This project was the culmination of CS 2830 Web Application Development. Throughout the semester, we learned different web programming concepts, and were
expected to use them in our final project.

For the development of this project, code was taken from CS 2830 instructor Nick Wergeles and modified in a way to meet the needs of my project. Comments made 
throughout the code reflect this, but the project itself was individual.
